# Steps in workshop
* setup your private neo blockchain using [neo-local](https://github.com/cityofzion/neo-local)
* First smart contract, definitely "Hello World": [helloworld.go](https://github.com/KickSeason/neo-go-workshop/tree/master/helloworld)
    * Learn using neo-python's build command with the test argument
    * Test differences between Log and Notify
* runtime smart contract, using runtime.GetTrigger, runtime.Verification, runtime.CheckWitness and runtime.Application: [runtime.go](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-storm/blob/master/examples/runtime/runtime.go)
* storage using smart contract: [storage.go](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-storm/blob/master/examples/storage/storage.go)
    * Storage is one of the key components of most smart contracts.
    * support bytes and string.
    * ~~Learn about debugstorage on/off/reset.~~
* Check out Dictionary support and neo.Runtime.Serialize
* a domain registration smart contract: [domain.go](https://github.com/KickSeason/neo-go-workshop/blob/master/domain/domain.go)
    * users can query, register, transfer and delete domains
    * important concept: checking of ownership
* neo nep5 smart contract: [nep5.go](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-storm/tree/master/examples/token), reference: [Step-by-step guide on issuing your NEP-5 token on NEOâ€™s Private net using Go](https://medium.com/coinmonks/neo-token-contract-nep-5-in-go-f6b0102c59ee)
* ICO template: [ICOTemplate.go](https://github.com/KickSeason/neo-go-workshop/blob/master/ICOTemplate/ICOTemplate.go)
